      "there are a million very different flatbreads they call Focaccia in Italy this is not one of them this is my own little Focaccia my goal was to make one that's flavorful enough to eat all by itself this dough holds a secret mini sheet pans are a great thing for the home kitchen they fit in the dishwasher and I don't need a whole sheet Pan's worth of bread I just need a little for that much I'll start with a cup of water 237 mils into that goes a teaspoon of dry yeast which is more than you'd normally use for Focaccia but I just really like the taste of extra fermentation summon forth the upside down bear or put in a little spoonful of any form of sugar mostly for flavor the yeast don't really need it now I've got some pecorino cheese but any hard grating cheese will do I'm gonna finely grate a little pile maybe 30 grams or thereabouts and yep I'm putting it directly inside my bread dough don't do much more than that or else it lessens your rise either chemically or physically I'm not sure of the mechanism maybe a teaspoon of this kosher salt certainly not more the cheese is salty and we're going to put a finishing salt on top of the bread for flavor and a little more substantial texture I'm throwing in a big spoonful of cornmeal it makes the bread really satisfying to chew on and then I like a couple of big spoonfuls of whole wheat flour the earthy Taste of the bran helps to balance the richness of the bread focaccia is generally soaked in olive oil now we need bread flour all of the dry ingredients we've put in thus far will weaken the gluten structure so we need extra gluten to compensate otherwise you can make Focaccia with straight all-purpose flour I'm also skipping any oil inside the dough because that would weaken the gluten Network too measure your bread flour if you want but I'm just going to stir it in until it looks right for a super high hydration dough like this I think a good trick is to see if you can lift the dough up with your spoon that just breaks it's still a paste not a dough I want to work in just enough flour until it behaves like a dough it's a coherent Mass I can pick it up and it won't just fall part that's good that gets you about 80 percent hydration which is perfect I probably got just under 200 grams of flour total in there that includes the whole wheat and the cornmeal no need to need just cover it and let it rise for a couple hours or throw it in the fridge and let it ferment slowly for a day or two if you have the time much better flavor that way and it's okay if this doesn't rise much in the fridge the gluten isn't developed enough to capture air bubbles but the fermentation has been happening it smells great though it's too sticky to handle when working with extremely wet doughs you can flour your hands or you can wet your hands to avoid sticking I want a really wet dough so I'm using water and I like to do this kind of thing right in the sink so that I can wet my hand over and over again I'm just grabbing an end stretching it out and then folding it back over the dough stretch and fold stretch and fold until the dough won't stretch anymore I'll grab my mini sheet pan and put in more than enough olive oil to coat Focaccia is basically a shallow fried bread while my hands are still oily I'll grab my dough and use it like a sponge to coat the inside of the pan with oil and to coat all sides of the dough in the process if you want to bake a bigger Focaccia in a normal home sheet pan Which is technically a half sheet pan you would just double or triple this recipe depending on how thick or thin you want the bread I'll push this out as flat as I can but I won't be able to do much the gluten is too tense from that stretching and folding cover this with something that won't actually touch the dough like a big bowl and let rise at room temperature until quite puffy an hour or two probably time now for me to earn that high carb high fat treat with a high protein breakfast from Magic spoon sponsor of this video in marked contrast with the Focaccia there is zero grain in Magic spoon zero grams sugar no sugar alcohols they use low cal Alternatives like allulose and Stevia to make better for me cereals that taste like the junk food of my childhood oh birthday cake this used to be a limited release they only did on the birthday of their company but the fans said they want it year round and now you can get it year round it tastes like sprinkles and yet it's basically made out of protein powder magic spoon is made of milk protein instead of grain 13 grams of protein in a serving of these absurd birthday O's snap my QR code or go to magicspoon.com regusia use my code regusia and get five dollars off the variety box of your choice I recommend the fruity but the new birthday cake is pretty awesome if you don't like it they'll give you your money back no questions asked link and code are in the description to save five dollars thank you magic spoon okay my dough has proofed I'll top it with a little more olive oil and then use my fingertips to Dimple the dough this is the classic way of docking Focaccia dough it keeps the bread from bulging into more of a round loaf shape in the oven and it creates little Wells to hold olive oil this will taste great and help this brown more in the oven I can also easily stretch the this out into the corners now since we let the gluten rest and relax and now is the time to sprinkle on some big crunchy salt I'm using Malden smoked sea salt which is my favorite finishing salt hashtag not an ad and just throw that in maybe a 400 degree Fahrenheit 200C oven while I wait I'll peel and chop some garlic reasonably fine then I'll chop up this fresh Sage Rosemary is more common on Focaccia but today I have sage and I love sage then I'll get a big knob of butter and put this into a microwave safe vessel with my garlic and I will microwave that until the butter is melted in the process the garlic will cook a bit and its flavor will mellow the easiest way to make garlic butter then I will add in my sage 400 F 200C is a little low for Focaccia but that's because I'm making a particularly thick one and it needs more time to bake through before the surface gets too dark when you poke it it should feel firmly springy when it's done that only took like 15 minutes while it's still hot I'm going to brush on my Herby garlic butter this tastes amazing and makes the bread shiny on top if you brush it on at the last minute these little pans came with a non-stick coating so I can slide my bread out but if you're working with a stickier pan line it with parchment paper before the dough goes in the cheese inside this dough makes it especially likely to stick here I baked a double batch inside my enameled roasting tray and it stuck so bad that I couldn't get it out learn from my mistakes let's cut that in half and this recipe definitely tends toward the spongier versions of Focaccia which I really like flavor is super rich and funky and fermented but also earthy from our adjunct grains have that with a glass of wine and call it dinner but Focaccia is uncommonly good for sandwiches because of how flat it is and how easy it is to bite through so I'm going to grate up some gruyere or any smooth melting cheese pile that on and then I've got some brazala which is cured beef probably my favorite salumi these days more cheese on top sandwich it up and you could wrap this in foil before it goes in the oven to keep soft but I want to let it crisp up all over so right on the bars the dirty pan will catch any drippings a few minutes later everything is melty and crispy and because this Focaccia is a little cake-like and brittle this whole sandwich is really easy to bite through without squeezing the fillings out the side that is living my friends that is lemon\n"

      "As an avid home baker, I was inspired by the incredible array of flatbreads in Italy (there are literally a million varieties!). But after trying them all, I realized that my goal wasn't to create one specific type of bread - it was just about finding something flavorful enough to eat on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this, I've developed a few tricks up my sleeve. One game-changer for me is using mini sheet pans instead of whole sheets. It's like having a little kitchen helper that makes cleanup a breeze! And by finely grating some hard cheese into the dough, I can add just the right amount of flavor without overpowering it.\n",

As some of you know, I've been experimenting with different recipes and techniques in the kitchen, and this one's got it all: flavor, texture, and convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to my Focaccia is a simple yet powerful combination: finely grated cheese (I'm talking 30 grams or so) and a little bit of sugar. Not only does it add depth to the dough, but it also helps with the fermentation process - trust me on that one! \n",
      "\n",
      "What's interesting is how I've optimized my recipe for maximum flavor without sacrificing rise time. It's all about balance, folks! By using less yeast than usual, I was able to achieve a similar rise without any added preservatives or chemicals.\n",

      "My goal was simple: make one that's flavorful enough to eat on its own - no dipping sauce needed! And what better way to do it than with the right dough? That's where this incredible Focaccia comes in. I've got my trusty mini sheet pans, and they fit perfectly in the dishwasher - talk about convenience!\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the magic: for this recipe, you won't need a whole batch of bread. Just 1 cup of water with 237 mils into it goes a teaspoon of dry yeast. That's right, just enough to give it a bit of an extra kick. Next, I add some finely grated pecorino cheese - about 30 grams should do the trick. And that's it! A simple mixture of flour, salt, water, yeast, and cheese.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "**Analysis of Quadrant IPO Video Transcripts**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Subscribe**: Neutral\n",
      "The transcripts suggest that the author is new to making glass bags and wants to learn from others, which could be a great opportunity for them to discover new techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Avoid**: Avoid (no clear reason mentioned)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Neutral**: Avoid (no clear reason mentioned)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Creative approach**: The author shares their personal experience of making glass bags with metal chains and provides detailed steps, showcasing creativity in the craft.\n",
      "2. **Tutorials for beginners**: The transcripts aim to educate readers on how to make a glass bag with a metal chain, indicating that the author is willing to share their knowledge.\n",
      "3. **No obvious flaws**: There are no glaring errors or mistakes mentioned in the transcripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lack of clear instructions**: While the author provides steps and techniques, it's unclear if they have experience working with glass bags with metal chains before attempting this project.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Potential for frustration**: The repetitive nature of the script may lead to frustration or boredom if the viewer is not following along closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inconsistent quality**: Some phrases are repeated multiple times throughout the transcript (e.g., \"Here's how I did it underneath K flip grab it go in there good beautiful\"), which may indicate inconsistent quality control.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GMP Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "- Grey Market Premium: There is no mention of a specific grey market premium in the transcripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Valuation Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Issue size**: The issue size and number of shares are not specified.\n",
      "2. **Lot size**: No information on lot sizes or pricing details is available.\n",
      "3. **Price band**: Unfortunately, no price band is mentioned for this IPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Subscription Status\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Subscription status**: Not applicable as the transcripts are publicly shared.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Price Band\n",
      "\n",
      "- Unfortunately, no price band is mentioned in the transcripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issue Size\n",
      "\n",

      "### Lot Size\n",
      "\n",
      "- No information on lot sizes or pricing details is available.\n",

      "### Important Dates\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Issue date**: Not explicitly stated.\n",
      "2. **Issue price**: Not specified.\n",
      "3. **Listing status**: The IPO appears to have been listed, but no specific date is mentioned.\n",
